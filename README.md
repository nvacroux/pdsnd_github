### Project Title
Analysis of Bikeshare Data with Python

### Description
This python program was developed for Udacity's Programming for Data Science with Python nanodegree.
* The program enables the user to select a city to analyze data for.
* The user can filter by a specific month, January through June, or use all the data.
* The user can filter by day of the week or use every day.
* The user can accept the analysis as is or view the raw data.

This program is the keystone project for the Introduction to Python module in the nanodegree program.  Details on the program can be found at https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104.

### Files used
The source data is in .csv files, one per city.  Included in this program are files for Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

### Credits
The basic framework for this program was provided by Udacity, with the code that performs the analysis being original.  The Udacity Python course provided most of the information necessary to complete the project, but the good folks at StackOverflow were helpful as well.  Unfortunately I did not log which SO topics I read so I cannot reference them individually here.
